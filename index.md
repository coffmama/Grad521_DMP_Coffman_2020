The bulk of the data storage for this project will be used by the video recordings, which will take approximately 22TB (figured at 540GB/hour of raw footage x 20 hours [10 weeks of 2 hour workshops] x 2 sections). However, the recordings will be confidential data, so will not be made publicly available. Each survey should take less than 50KB of data—assuming the study is conducted in two sections, that would work out to under 300KB of data. I don’t know how much space the coding data from the recordings will take, but 200KB seems to be a generous estimate. In all, I think that the permanently stored and publicly available data should be less than 500KB.
