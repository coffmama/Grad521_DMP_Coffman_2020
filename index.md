#Data management plan



#Data description

The feasibility study will generate both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data would be generated by pre-, post, and follow-up surveys measuring participant perceptions of issues such as loneliness, depression, fatigue, anxiety, accessibility, etc. The qualitative data would be gathered via open-ended survey questions and recordings of the workshops for later coding. 

#Roles and responsibilities

For my dissertation research, I will be directly responsible for implementing my DMP, although my work will be supervised by my PI. I believe that the same would be true for project organization—-I will draft a strategy, submit it for approval, and provide regular updates. While my PI would technically be the person ultimately responsible for correct data management and preservation of confidentiality, it would be up to me to make sure everything is collected, documented, organized, depersonalized, stored, analyzed, and shared properly. 

#Data standards

The approved IRB application, university guidelines, research plan, and data management plan will dictate how I manage my data. My doctoral program guarantees funding for dissertation research, so I may not have a funder with additional data management requirements. If I do seek external funding, any data management requirements would depend on the source—-a regional arts authority might be very interested in supporting music intervention research, but not have enough familiarity with the research process to ask for a DMP. Federal agencies, on the other hand, provide very clear guidelines. There would not be any contracts or disclosure agreements that affect my work.

#Storage and Security

My inital data would be confidential. In order to protect my participants’ identities, I would delete video files once they had been coded and depersonalize survey and other data before sharing with a data repository. This would all be included in my IRB application.

#Access and data sharing

Because my PI is not expert on all of the analytical tools I would like to use, she has told me I will need to work with another faculty member for part of the project design and analysis. I may also need to use student coders to analyze videos of the workshops, but no one besides my PI and myself would have access to all of the raw data. If anyone leaves the project, their access to the data will be revoked.

#Archiving and data sharing

The bulk of the data storage for this project will be used by the video recordings, which will take approximately 22TB. However, those recordings will be confidential and will not be made publicly available. The permanently stored and publicly available data, including survey data and coding data, should be less than 500KB.
