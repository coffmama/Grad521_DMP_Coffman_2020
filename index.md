# Project Overview

My recently concluded pilot study, Songwriting With Celiacs: The Impact of Creative Process on Depression & Anxiety, investigated the impact of songwriting education and practice on levels of depression, fatigue, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction in adults diagnosed with Celiac Disease. The study was expanded for recruitment purposes to include participants coping with any form of moderate to severe chronic illness. Based on the favorable results, I propose to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the validity and adaptability for an online version of this intervention, while collecting data that I was not able to document in the pilot. Ideally, I would also be able to test hypotheses about the cognitive mechanisms and communication theories I’ve used to explain the pilot data. 

# Data description

The feasibility study will generate both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data would be generated by pre-, post, and follow-up surveys measuring participant perceptions of issues such as loneliness, depression, fatigue, anxiety, accessibility, etc. The qualitative data would be gathered via open-ended survey questions and video recordings of the workshops for later coding. 

# Roles and responsibilities

I will be directly responsible for implementing my DMP, although my work will be supervised by my PI. I believe that the same would be true for project organization—-I will draft a strategy, submit it for approval, and provide regular updates. While my PI would technically be the person ultimately responsible for correct data management and preservation of confidentiality, it would be up to me to make sure everything is collected, documented, organized, depersonalized, stored, analyzed, and shared properly. 

# Data standards

The approved IRB application, university guidelines, research plan, and data management plan will dictate how I manage my data. My doctoral program guarantees funding for dissertation research, so I may not have a funder with additional data management requirements. If I do seek external funding, any data management requirements would depend on the source—-a regional arts authority may have a vested interest in supporting music intervention research, but not enough familiarity with the research process to ask for a DMP. Federal agencies, on the other hand, provide very clear guidelines. There would not be any contracts or partner disclosure agreements.

# Storage and Security

In order to protect my participants’ identities, I will delete video files once they have been coded and depersonalize survey and other data before sharing with a repository. This would all be included in my IRB application.

# Access and data sharing

If necessary, additional faculty members may be recruited to add expertise with certain analytical tools. I may also use student coders to analyze videos of the workshops, but no one besides my PI and myself would have access to all of the raw data. If anyone leaves the project, their access to the data will be revoked.

# Archiving and data sharing

The bulk of the data storage for this project will be used by the video recordings, which will take approximately 22TB. However, those recordings will be confidential and will not be made publicly available. The permanently stored and publicly available data, including survey data and coding data, should be less than 500KB.
