# Project Overview

My recently concluded pilot study, Songwriting With Celiacs: The Impact of Creative Process on Depression & Anxiety, investigated the impact of songwriting education and practice on levels of depression, fatigue, anxiety, stress, and quality of life in adults diagnosed with Celiac Disease. The study was expanded for recruitment purposes to include participants coping with any form of moderate to severe chronic illness. Based on the favorable results, I propose to conduct a feasibility study evaluating the validity and adaptability of an online version of this intervention, which would also allow me to collect types of data that I was not able to document in the pilot. Ideally, I will also be able to test hypotheses about the cognitive mechanisms and communication theories I’ve used to explain the pilot data. 

# Data description

The feasibility study will generate both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data will be generated by pre-, post, and follow-up surveys measuring participant perceptions of issues such as loneliness, depression, fatigue, anxiety, and accessibility, distributed via Qualtrics and exported/saved in csv format. The qualitative data will be gathered via open-ended survey questions and video recordings of the workshops for later coding. Open-ended survey responses will be organized by question number, survey number, and date (i.e., qual question 1_survey 2 responses_date collected). During analysis, workshop recordings will be clearly dated and reference corresponding metadata in the lab notebook and curriculum activities. 

# Roles and responsibilities

I will be directly responsible for implementing my DMP while supervised by my PI. Though my PI will be the person ultimately responsible for correct data management and preservation of confidentiality, it will be my job to make sure data is collected, documented, organized, deidentified, stored, analyzed, and shared properly. 

# Data Storage and Metadata

Once project is completed, all non-confidential data will be stored in a repository with a significant collection of social science arts research, such as ICPSR. Metadata will be unstructured and include project description, study design, program curriculum, data collection methods and measures used, lab notebook, software/methods for analysis, and data dictionary. Clearly named and dated files will ensure data is findable and reproducable. 

# Data standards

The approved IRB application, university guidelines, research plan, and data management plan will dictate how I manage my data. My doctoral program guarantees funding for dissertation research, so I may not have a funder with additional data management requirements. If I do seek external funding, any data management requirements would depend on the source—-a regional arts authority may have a vested interest in supporting music intervention research, but not enough familiarity with the research process to ask for a DMP. Federal agencies, on the other hand, provide very clear guidelines. There would not be any contracts or partner disclosure agreements.

# Security

In order to protect my participants’ identities, I will delete video files once they have been coded and remove direct and indirect identifiers from qualitative and quantitative data before sharing with a repository. 

# Access and data sharing

I will  use student coders to analyze videos of the workshops and additional faculty members will be recruited to add expertise with certain analytical tools. However, no one besides my PI and myself will have access to all of the raw data. If anyone leaves the project, their access to the data will be revoked. The data sharing and access plans will be approved in my IRB application before the study begins.

# Archiving 

The bulk of the data storage for this project will be used by the recordings of the online workshops, which will take approximately 25GB, but those recordings will be deleted to maintain confidentiality. The permanently stored and publicly available data, including survey data and coding data, will total less than 500KB.
